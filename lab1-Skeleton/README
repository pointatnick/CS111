README for Lab 1A CS 111.

The approach we took was as the following: check all syntax in the
beginning for the characters in the file, then reading everything
into a buffer. Using that buffer, we parsed the characters into different
command tokens, and inserted them into a linked list of nodes using a
recursive function. Upon creating a complete linked list of all the
commands in the file, we read each node accordingly.
