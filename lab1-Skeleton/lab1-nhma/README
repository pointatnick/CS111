README for Lab 1A CS 111.

The approach we took was as the following: check all syntax in the
beginning for the characters in the file, then reading everything
into a buffer. Using that buffer, we parsed the characters into different
command tokens, and inserted them into a linked list of nodes using a
recursive function. Upon creating a complete linked list of all the
commands in the file, we read each node accordingly. However, we have
trouble returning each node for printing.

LIMITATIONS
We were able to parse commands properly from a file, but we could not
read them out and print them. We could print the values as we were making
our commands, but these could not be read by read_command_stream. We were
able to insert the parsed commands into our linked list structure, and in
proper order. The errors seem to occur when we try to free memory.
